	<summary><H1>3 positives for every negative</H1></summary>
	<p>On my short walk to class yesterday, I thought of a new idea: 2 positives for 1 negative is a very broken system. The percentages wouldn’t be equal enough, and it would be difficult to decide the exact percentage.</p>
	<p>3 positives to 1 negative is better, as the positives would be 75% and the negative would be the other 25% it would also work well as 1-4  (1-9) 1-19 1-24 1-49 1-99.</p>
	<p>Conclusion: Be more positive</p>
	<p>TL:DR: More positives makes easier math</p>

	<!-- <H1>Plan:<wbr> rebuild<wbr> my<wbr> minecraft<wbr> worlds</H1> !-->
	<H2>Made<wbr> by<wbr> Sean<wbr> P.<wbr> Myrick</H2>
	<p>Yes,<wbr> I<wbr> know<wbr> Minecraft<wbr> isn't<wbr> as<wbr> popular<wbr> as<wbr> it<wbr> once<wbr> was<wbr>, but<wbr> it<wbr> was<wbr> a<wbr> huge<wbr> part<wbr> of<wbr> my<wbr> childhood<wbr> up<wbr> until<wbr> the<wbr> day<wbr> that<wbr> I<wbr> lost<wbr> all<wbr> my<wbr> progress.<wbr> I<wbr> don't<wbr> know<wbr> what<wbr> happened,<wbr> my<wbr> account<wbr> was<wbr> unable<wbr> to<wbr> sign<wbr> in<wbr>, and<wbr> the<wbr> launcher<wbr> had<wbr> errors.<wbr> Keep<wbr> in<wbr> mind,<wbr> at<wbr> the<wbr> time<wbr> I<wbr> was<wbr> still<wbr> using<wbr> Minecraft<wbr> 1.8,<wbr> waiting<wbr> for<wbr> 1.9<wbr> to<wbr> come<wbr> out,<wbr> a<wbr> pretty<wbr> long<wbr> time<wbr> ago.</p>
	<p>When it crashed, I was in shock. I didn't think too much of it. Every time I tried to go near it again, I had issues. Lately, as of March 2019, I am really getting into it again, almost 3 full years later. I am determined to not give up now. I have the worlds still in memory (in my brain) and I am considering remaking all of the worlds.</p>
	<p>There are a few requirements first:</p>
	<p>• <b><i>Wait for Windows 8 to go out of support in 2025 (I thought it was already dead years ago until I looked it up today.)</i></b></p>
	<p>• <b><i>Obtain a copy of Minecraft 1.8</i></b></p>
	<p>• <b><i>Get better virtual machine knowledge and support (shared folders, prevent corruption from no usage (my machines randomly got corrupted one day and I don't know why) learn how to export to other machines)</i></b></p>
	<p>I really hope I can do this. It might take me a very long time to do this, as I don't have as much free time anymore. It would be really nice to have everything back again! Thanks to RTGame for the videos that have peaked my interest in trying again.</p>

	<summary><H1>How SNU has changed my life</H1></summary>
	<p>Development on SNU has lasted for 2 months now, and it has changed my life behind the scenes. I have put in hours upon hours of effort into SNU, on a daily basis. I have dropped certain activities and projects, and I have learned a lot from it.</p>
	<p>One of the first things that had to go was my gaming. I haven't played games on my phone in a long time now, and I used to play everyday for almost a whole year.</p>
	<p>It has also changed the way I work and gave me a great taste of web design. Thanks to W3schools, I have achieved a very good level of HTML knowledge, and it is a very helpful reference.</p>
	<p>This site still has a long ways to go, and I enjoy the experience it has given me.</p>

	<summary><H1>How I learned to like Emojis</H1></summary>	
	<p>While developing SNU, I used special characters. They made the site look better in ways. However, there was a limit between special characters and Emojis. Eventually, I started placing Emojis next to titles of sections, and it made it look more lively.</p>
	<p>Emojis get lost in translation. I am going to keep the original text there, as it would be difficult to figure out what it was with just Emojis, and it would be unprofessional.</p>
	<p>I mainly use Emojis on the sidebars of my website, however that could change. Using them has made me like them more. It is better than black, white, and grey characters in the right situations.</p>

	<summary><H1>Why you shouldn't use adblock with SNU</H1></summary>
	<p>Most sites don't let you control what ads you see without paying for premium... that is unless you use an adblock. However, SNU is different. SNU lets you control what ads you see. If a specific ad or type of ad bothers you, you can just turn it off via ad settings</p>
	<p>You can't turn ads off completely though, as ads are a way to support the site. We have decided to punish people who use adblock on SNU. If you have your content monetized, you will lose 1 cent of revenue for every ad that is blocked. Make sure to whitelist our site.</p>

	<p>SNU has received a massive update today, mainly involving user profiles. I have put in lots of effort today into making a template account that mimics what a profile looks like</p>
	<p>I think it is a pretty good example. However, it is going to take A LOT of work. So far, just the basic HTML is over 80 Kilobytes in size. I haven't even added any styles or many images yet</p>

	<p>Just taking this one day at a time, I will eventually get a good layout finished and a good testing server.</p>
	<p>Also, I am going to start using paragraphs and bolding instead of just all headings for my HTML style</p>
	<p>One last thing, I have decided to start and keep documentation in the blog section of the profile test account (where you currently are) it may get copied in the future, but the original will remain here</p>

	<p>I have began to add Blender into legends of the internet because who said I had to stop after social media? This is for all internet content</p>
	<p>Today, I have also resumed development on my calculator, so website development may be a little slower. I am not getting burnt out as easily anymore either</p>
	<p>I also updated the blog documentation and exported all documents into different formats from Day 7 to Day 11, and Week 1 as well</p>

	<H2>SNU 3.0 Developer log day 8</H2>
	<p>Today is the first day of the second week of development. Honestly, I think these burnout periods I am experiencing are actually helpful, as it spans out more time for me to implent and think of new ideas and ways to shape SNU into the way I want it to be</p>
	<p>This is just the very tip of the iceberg, but this site has so much potential</p>
	<p>Today, I worked on hyperlinks through multiple files and setting up "index bases" in the SNU 2 folders so SNU 3 can have easy access to the legacy version</p>

	<p>I have now reached the point with this site where it is as functional as SNU 1. I can legitimately say I am browsing SNU. However, this is just the structure. The fun part comes later. However, I haven't outperformed the original SNU yet, however some of its content is finally over to the new site</p>
	<p>Today, I worked on making alternates to the rich formatting versions of specific pages, increasing documentation, and working on blogs. I got a lot done again today as well. I also updated the site to version 3.04 and added Big Buck Bunny content in. Since I added over 10 gigabytes today, I have decided I will follow a new update schedule:</p>
	<p>I will continue working on the site daily, but I can't make an entirely new version all the time. I can only make a new version every 4 months. This is to conserve the last 490 Gigabytes on my laptops hard drive. This is the way it will be until I get a new computer or a better spot for memory</p>

	<p>After some research, I decided that I need to put a little less focus on customizing menus and such and work on making the foundation for a good algorithm. There are lots of variables and conditions that go into the SNU algorithm, and it is going to take YEARS to implemeent</p>
	<p>I am really hoping I don't have to make another re-write, 3 versions is already alot. It took Microsoft 3 tries for Windows, and they got it on the third try. I haven't been as lucky yet, however none of my projects have been publically released</p>
	<p>SNU 3 has a chance, maybe even SNU 1 if Google can give me my website back already. It just won't let me download it</p>

	<p>I am really happy with the complete makeover of the start page yesterday. It looks great. Today, I re-implemented some older SNU features such as gilding, achievements, and leveling up. I also did a little maintenance to the Valve legends page</p>
	<p>I have finally started taking snapshots of separate files on these builds. I should have done this sooner. Now I can make updates to pages separately without copying over the entire directory, which is over 15 gigabytes, and that is not an option anymore due to the space required for frequent backups</p>
	<p>Snapshots are now another new way to view older versions of a page, while keeping the modern page in-tact</p>
	<p>I went to test Google sites downloading again today. I downloaded the old, old SNU, but not the version 1. Still waiting on that. At least we have SNU 0.1 now</p>

	<p>I am back from my vacation. I have some updates</p>
	<p>I did some work on this site today on the car trip back to Walla Walla. </p>
	<p>Mostly, the work I did was for the pie pivot-o archive. I got 20 videos embedded during the car ride</p>
	<p>So I have to make a website for my parents apartment. I don't have a server to dedicate to this, and my HTML and web development skills aren't good enough to make this on my local harddrive so for now, I am going to have to make it in Google sites</p>
	<p>Once Google allows downloading your modern Google sites websites, it will be all good. This is a mini-project, it shouldn't take long, and it would give me a little exposure</p>
	<p>I made a basic demo of the site today, and it works well</p>

	<p>Today was an easy day for this project. I haven't been feeling that good, a lot of anxiery pain. So I finished up the Pie Pivot-o Tribute by adding all video descriptions, and his opinion on CharmX, and I also added 2 new features to SNU:</p>
	<p>User !666 and !Heaven</p>
	<p>The 666 user is SNUs personal hell. You can visit it, where I try to make the most demonic scary part of the site. I also made a transition and made SNU heaven, a place with the all-time best content, and links to the fallen creators</p>
	<p>I did some updates to the update log and the developer log, and that is pretty much it.</p>

	<p>I am really glad I introduced the new snapshot system into this SNU project. Recently this morning, there was a severe system crash. My computer froze for over 20 minutes, and I lost 20 minutes worth of work on a new build on a different project</p>
	<p>It would be really unfortunate to lose ANY page in this collection, so Snapshots are going to be important</p>
	<p>Today, I am rebooting development on Legends of the Internet. Today, I focus on Vinesauce and 4Chan</p>
	<p>I am also working on the new time-machine mode, viewing media from different time periods. Currently it goes down all the way to 1788</p>

	<H2>SNU 3.0 Developer log day 23</H2>
	<p>I took a break from development today. I had an appointment in Spokane and a mini business vacation</p>
	<p>Sean Patrick Myrick on February 22nd 2019</p>
	<H2>SNU 3.0 Developer log day 24</H2>
	<p>I am back from my vacation. I have some updates</p>
	<p>I did some work on this site today on the car trip back to Walla Walla. </p>
	<p>Mostly, the work I did was for the pie pivot-o archive. I got 20 videos embedded during the car ride</p>
	<p>So I have to make a website for my parents apartment. I don't have a server to dedicate to this, and my HTML and web development skills aren't good enough to make this on my local harddrive so for now, I am going to have to make it in Google sites</p>
	<p>Once Google allows downloading your modern Google sites websites, it will be all good. This is a mini-project, it shouldn't take long, and it would give me a little exposure</p>
	<p>I made a basic demo of the site today, and it works well</p>
	<p>Sean Patrick Myrick on February 23rd 2019</p>
	<H2>SNU 3.0 Developer log day 25</H2>
	<p>Today was an easy day for this project. I haven't been feeling that good, a lot of anxiery pain. So I finished up the Pie Pivot-o Tribute by adding all video descriptions, and his opinion on CharmX, and I also added 2 new features to SNU:</p>
	<p>User !666 and !Heaven</p>
	<p>The 666 user is SNUs personal hell. You can visit it, where I try to make the most demonic scary part of the site. I also made a transition and made SNU heaven, a place with the all-time best content, and links to the fallen creators</p>
	<p>I did some updates to the update log and the developer log, and that is pretty much it.</p>
	<p>Sean Patrick Myrick on February 24th 2019</p>
	<H2>SNU 3.0 Developer log day 26</H2>
	<p>I am really glad I introduced the new snapshot system into this SNU project. Recently this morning, there was a severe system crash. My computer froze for over 20 minutes, and I lost 20 minutes worth of work on a new build on a different project</p>
	<p>It would be really unfortunate to lose ANY page in this collection, so Snapshots are going to be important</p>
	<p>Today, I am rebooting development on Legends of the Internet. Today, I focus on Vinesauce and 4Chan</p>
	<p>I am also working on the new time-machine mode, viewing media from different time periods. Currently it goes down all the way to 1788</p>
	<p>Sean Patrick Myrick on February 25th 2019</p>
	<H2>SNU 3.0 Developer log day 27</H2>
	<p>Not much was done today. The developer log hasn't been exported in a while, and I still don't know when I am going to get to that. Today, I worked on the developer log, the time machine (codename Timebox) and the update log</p>
	<p>Sean Patrick Myrick on February 26th 2019</p>
	<H2>SNU 3.0 Developer log day 28</H2>
	<p>First day inactive, I am working on another project at the moment</p>

	<p>SNU is not dead, but it is going to need to be repaired a little bit. I am going to start doing big repairs when I get better at CSS, I am just starting with it. HTML seems easy but CSS really makes it fun. Today, I simply updated the developer and update logs.</p>

	<p>Today, I got no progress on the site, I was working on a Factorial Machine for my calculator, and I managed to perfect it to its limits. Development on SNU will continue tomorrow.</p>

	<p>Yesterday was a really productive day. Today wasn't. I was really hyper today, and had a lack of focus on different projects. I wasn't able to do anything to SNU today. So I have also grown a new hobby, bookmarks. This is a small hobby, I am making a very organized bookmarks file system in Firefox to help me organizr tabs better. This list will be updated and added to SNU every day a change is made. </a>
	<p>This hobby should not replace SNU</p>
	<p>Later in the day, I hit a limit, then surpassed it with bookmarks and separaters. I thought there was a limit, but I just made an error. However just today, the number of bookmarks and separaters over doubled with my bookmark archive and I didn't get much done with SNU except for a basic stylesheet on the start page, archive updates, and writing to the blog</p>
	<p>Today could have been a lot better, hopefully my excitement with bookmarks will go down soon</p>

	<p>Development hasn't been going that well lately. The Filthy Frank tribute is also going to be reset, as I found a master archive with all his videos, and I can't apply it right now as I need to conserve memory better.</p>
	<p>I have also been developing SNU mostly in English. I need to make it available to other languages, but I don't have any secondary languages I am good at, and I cannot rely on Google translate.</p>
	<p>So I am going to have to work on smaller features, by the kilobyte, NOT THE MEGABYTE OR GIGABYTE.</p>
	<p>One of my new ideas this morning is personal pages for peoples pets. This will require some moderation, but wouldn't it be nice to be able to create a separate account specially designed for animals?</p>
	<p>There are a lot of projects I am working on right now and it is going to correlate to SNU very well. There are a few features in beta right now:</p>
	<p>Password generator [Python] current version: 1.04</p>

	<p>WebShapes3D [Java] current version: 1.00</p>

	<p>Today, I created event pages for the world wide webs 30th anniversary (2 days late) and Pi-day, along with other changes. Development is going at normal speed right now</p>
	<p>I spotted an issue with the website today: the front page of 2D mode has some lag to it. It is just loading off a hard drive right now, not even connected to the internet, and I don't know what is causing the lag. There aren't ANY videos on the page, the document file size is less than 40 kilobytes, it has a solid background, not an excessive amount of tezt, some images, and animations, hyperlinks, and that is pretty much it.</p>
	<p>I need to fix this issue before it gets worse, but I don't know how.</p>

	<p>Today wasn't the best day for development. I have been busy with a lot of other projects (keep in mind, I am still running my entire business singlehandedly, it takes a while) however now there is another project that is going to take time: a new Tetris game I am making</p>
	<p>SNU development will continue, this Tetris project should give me better experience for how I want to style SNU's graphics.</p>
	<p>Orher than that, I pretty much took the day off, worked on my Scratch project archive, watched videos, worked on bookmarks, and took time off.</p>
	<p>There have been some pretty great development days this week and I am going to stick by them, and work on improvements over time peacefully.</p>

	<H2>SNU 3.0 Developer log day 43</H2>
	<p>Today, I created event pages for the world wide webs 30th anniversary (2 days late) and Pi-day, along with other changes. Development is going at normal speed right now</p>
	<p>I spotted an issue with the website today: the front page of 2D mode has some lag to it. It is just loading off a hard drive right now, not even connected to the internet, and I don't know what is causing the lag. There aren't ANY videos on the page, the document file size is less than 40 kilobytes, it has a solid background, not an excessive amount of tezt, some images, and animations, hyperlinks, and that is pretty much it.</p>
	<p>I need to fix this issue before it gets worse, but I don't know how.</p>

	<H2>SNU 3.0 Developer log day 44</H2>
	<p>Not much was done to the site today. I have developed a routine to keep development going daily. Those steps were taken. A new meme section was added, but it requires extensive work before I allow memes in it</p>

	<p>I was going to back up my laptop today, but I slept in by accident. So the next backup will happen during Spring break.</p>
	<p>Today, I added a copypasta kitchen, with some testing to get copypastas ready to use by a single click. There is a lot to the copypasta kitchen.</p>
	<p>Daily update features were added as well. However, today wasn't the best day of development. A few minimal changes here and there were made.</p>
	<p>Updates will continue to flow.</p>

	<p>Today wasn't the best day for development. I have been busy with a lot of other projects (keep in mind, I am still running my entire business singlehandedly, it takes a while) however now there is another project that is going to take time: a new Tetris game I am making</p>
	<p>SNU development will continue, this Tetris project should give me better experience for how I want to style SNU's graphics.</p>

	<p>Today is my 18th birthday! Unfortunately, it is a school day, so I am going to have a shorter party. I got some work done on SNU, it is coming along great now! I am upgrading the sidebar CSS and it makes the sidebar perfect! Once I get the sidebar to a point where I like it enough, and it works correspondingly with the top navigation bar, I will consider adding sidebars to all pages. Each page will have its own unique sidebar.</p>
	<p>Today wasn't the day for my bookmark system though, however that is just a small hobby. Mini updates went around SNU today, with snapshots for multiple pages, and documentation upgrades. Today was pretty good.</p>
	<p>So lately I have been thinking about what I should use as a domain name for SNU. www.snu.net would be a difficult name to get, but it would make it extremely easy for people to access the site. www.socialnetworkultimate.net or www.social-network-ultimate.net seem a little long, and I don't know how much I am going to have to spend to get the domain "snu" its just a domain name, but it can make a big difference.</p>
	<p>This site is still years from being ready for launch, so I have time.</p>

	<p>Today was a stressful day in development. A LOT of time was put into making a translation page for the start page, where people can contribute more languages to SNU. I really want SNU to be available in more languages, not just English, but this document is taking forever to write. The translator itself is larger than the original page, and I am not even halfway done yet.</p>
	<p>Other than that, I needed a break, so I worked on the update log and template account blogs. I hope to move to a more exciting project again soon.</p>

	<p>So the Article 13 from the European Union is up for debate again, however I really doubt it is going to pass. There is already so much hate for it, and it seems like mainly only Germany is supporting it, so I don't see it passing. If it ever does pass, there will be a revolution. I honestly don't know why they keep trying with this.</p>
	<p>Even if it does pass, I will continue to work on SNU, as I hope to finish it some day. Today was a decent day for development. I made a few changes, and increased language support (except people are going to need to translate it) the translation form for 2DStart is ready. All I need now is someone who can speak English and another language fluentlu and is willing to take the time to help translate each snapshot</p>
	<p>For the SNU translations for the 2D start page, I got significant progress today, adding support for up to 104 languages (when translated). It took hours, but it will be worth it when the whole world can enjoy SNU.</p>

Hopefully they repeal it by the time my site launches, or it is really going to suck for them.</p>
	<p>Today, I applied notices about that, and worked on a new virtual machine player.</p>

	<p>Today was an evaluation day. Nothing much happened to SNU. Plus today is the first day of Spring break. I needed a little break. I am starting development on my calculator again. I am evaluating on things like:</p>
	<p><i><b> • How I should manage my projects</b></i></p>
	<p><i><b> • Worker goals</b></i></p>
	<p><i><b> • How I am going to operate the calculator (if I should use custom functions or not)</b></i></p>
	<p>I also took today as a break. I focused on smaller projects only, all I did for SNU today was update the developer log, and update log.</p>

	<p>Today wasn't the best day for development, however not many of the main features are being implemented.</p>
	<p>One thing I like about April fools day, is that I get to see peoples creative and comedic approaches to making a fool out of someone.</p>
	<p>Also, due to time zones, some people upload their April fools day jokes on April 1st in their time zone, but March 31st in other timezones. For this reason, it is still considered April fools day on March 31st for some time zones, and April 1st for other time zones</p>
	<p>Unfortunately, I didn't have any April fools day ideas for the site this year, so you can accept the one from yesterday. I have also decided to bring in another feature to SNU, a map of the universe. Like Google Earth, but universal, more interactive, and more advanced.</p>
	<p>It will be available strictly in 3D mode, and you will be able to see not only Earth, but the moon, Mars, the sun, even past the Milky Way Galaxy. This is a future idea, and it is going to take insane amount of memory in a standard 3 years from today.</p>
	<p>I hope someday I can work together with NASA, and other space organizations to increase the functionality of the universal map, and get new data for it.</p>

	<p>Yeah, yesterday's announcement on SNU Universe wasn't a joke. That is going to be a real thing. Sorry about the poor April fools day yesterday, I wasn't really prepared, and I don't have an audience besides myself to get feedback, as SNU is still in a very early beta.</p>
	<p>Today, I got a lot done. I sat down and worked for over 2 hours this morning. I added in lots of new features, such as ad settings, where you can manage what ads you see, a big update to the dashboard, finishing up the colored text in the HTML master sheet, and brief documentation.</p>
	<p>I have other things to do today, hopefully I can come back to developing SNU again later.</p>
	<p>I managed to get a lot done on it later in the day as well. Despite only getting 6 hours of sleep last night, this has been my most productive day in a week.</p>

	<p>Today was a dark day outside, lack of sunlight can be depressing. I didn't have much planned for SNU today, so I did minimal updates. I am predicting this, but if we launch SNU universe, Google is going to make Google Mars or a different name/expansion to Google earth.</p>
	<p>I don't have the skills right now to make it, but it is under way within the idea list.</p>
	<p>Today, I had to go search for hate symbols to update the anti-racism engine. SNU will allow these symbols ONLY in educational, historical, and parody purposes, but promoting hate speech on SNU could result in permanent account suspension.</p>
	<p>Later in the day, I started playing games again. I haven't played these games on my phone since February 28th 2019. I didn't have the best time coming back, but I remembered some things that I need to implement into my ad system.</p>
	<p>Later on, I did a minor update.</p>

	<p>For now, most of the new style is being placed on the blog page for templateaccount, which is my testing account for what an account should be styled like. Today, I also added new support to the virtual machine system, and updated other pages to keep the site up to date.</p>
	<p>My spring break finally starts tomorrow, and I will be able to get a lot more done.</p>

	<H2>SNU 3.0 Developer log day 59</H2>
	<p>Today was an evaluation day. Nothing much happened to SNU. Plus today is the first day of Spring break. I needed a little break. I am starting development on my calculator again. I am evaluating on things like:</p>
	<p><i><b> • How I should manage my projects</b></i></p>
	<p><i><b> • Worker goals</b></i></p>
	<p><i><b> • How I am going to operate the calculator (if I should use custom functions or not)</b></i></p>
	<p>I also took today as a break. I focused on smaller projects only, all I did for SNU today was update the developer log, and update log.</p>

	<H2>SNU 3.0 Developer log day 60</H2>
	<p>April fools day is tomorrow. We have decided not to do a prank like "Rick rolling" so that is off the table. If you want to get rick rolled, <a href="MARCHFOOLS2019.html">Click here</a></p>
	<p>Today is the day after yesterday's evaluation day. Results came in positive, and I am able to work on SNU again today. I updated the developer and update logs, and added new features.</p>
	<p>Sean Patrick Myrick on March 31st 2019</p>
	<H2>SNU 3.0 Developer log day 61</H2>
	<p>Today wasn't the best day for development, however not many of the main features are being implemented.</p>
	<p>One thing I like about April fools day, is that I get to see peoples creative and comedic approaches to making a fool out of someone.</p>
	<p>Also, due to time zones, some people upload their April fools day jokes on April 1st in their time zone, but March 31st in other timezones. For this reason, it is still considered April fools day on March 31st for some time zones, and April 1st for other time zones</p>
	<p>Unfortunately, I didn't have any April fools day ideas for the site this year, so you can accept the one from yesterday. I have also decided to bring in another feature to SNU, a map of the universe. Like Google Earth, but universal, more interactive, and more advanced.</p>
	<p>It will be available strictly in 3D mode, and you will be able to see not only Earth, but the moon, Mars, the sun, even past the Milky Way Galaxy. This is a future idea, and it is going to take insane amount of memory in a standard 3 years from today.</p>
	<p>I hope someday I can work together with NASA, and other space organizations to increase the functionality of the universal map, and get new data for it.</p>
	<p>Sean Patrick Myrick on April 1st 2019</p>
	<H2>SNU 3.0 Developer log day 62</H2>
	<p>Yeah, yesterday's announcement on SNU Universe wasn't a joke. That is going to be a real thing. Sorry about the poor April fools day yesterday, I wasn't really prepared, and I don't have an audience besides myself to get feedback, as SNU is still in a very early beta.</p>
	<p>Today, I got a lot done. I sat down and worked for over 2 hours this morning. I added in lots of new features, such as ad settings, where you can manage what ads you see, a big update to the dashboard, finishing up the colored text in the HTML master sheet, and brief documentation.</p>
	<p>I have other things to do today, hopefully I can come back to developing SNU again later.</p>
	<p>I managed to get a lot done on it later in the day as well. Despite only getting 6 hours of sleep last night, this has been my most productive day in a week.</p>

	<H2>SNU 3.0 Developer log day 63</H2>
	<p>Today was a dark day outside, lack of sunlight can be depressing. I didn't have much planned for SNU today, so I did minimal updates. I am predicting this, but if we launch SNU universe, Google is going to make Google Mars or a different name/expansion to Google earth.</p>
	<p>I don't have the skills right now to make it, but it is under way within the idea list.</p>
	<p>Today, I had to go search for hate symbols to update the anti-racism engine. SNU will allow these symbols ONLY in educational, historical, and parody purposes, but promoting hate speech on SNU could result in permanent account suspension.</p>
	<p>Later in the day, I started playing games again. I haven't played these games on my phone since February 28th 2019. I didn't have the best time coming back, but I remembered some things that I need to implement into my ad system.</p>
	<p>Later on, I did a minor update.</p>

	<p>Today wasn't the best day for development. It is on the decline again. SNU is getting really advanced now, and I am going to have to learn a new language (possibly PHP) and further Javascript and CSS to improve the site more.</p>
	<p>The ad engine is getting really good. Soon I am going to get these options to work. I hope it makes ad creators more diverse, and creative, as that is what this engine promotes: difference. SNU users can choose whatever ads they want, they don't have to deal with bad ads. They are in control of that.</p>
	<p>However, everyone has a different definition on what a bad ad is, that is why they get to set up the ad engine settings to their preference. I really hope people take the time to set up their accounts, as you can get massive benefits while using SNU if done right.</p>
	<p>Today was just a filler day, I did some updates to common features, along with the ad engine.</p>

	<p>So last night I got stressed out, as I realized that wr are getting close to reaching the limit of a silicon chip, and the obsolesence of Moore's law. I am going to have to be more careful with resources, however it shouldn't be too much of an issue, as we have 1 terabyte SD cards that are extremely tiny. We could probably get several petabytes of data in a laptop if we had enough.</p>
	<p>I wonder what the next big thing will be.</p>
	<p>Today, I applied minor updates to SNU, updated pages, and worked on other projects.</p>
