<H1>3 positives for every negative</H1>
<p>On my short walk to class yesterday, I thought of a new idea: 2 positives for 1 negative is a very broken system. The percentages wouldn’t be equal enough, and it would be difficult to decide the exact percentage.</p>
<p>3 positives to 1 negative is better, as the positives would be 75% and the negative would be the other 25% it would also work well as 1-4  (1-9) 1-19 1-24 1-49 1-99.</p>
<p>Conclusion: Be more positive</p>
<p>TL:DR: More positives makes easier math</p>

<H1>SNU 3.0 Developer log day 1</H1>
<p>Today is the first day of SNU 3 development. Version 2.0 was a failure, as it wasn't possible to work with the code I had, and it had poor planning. Version 3 is already looking really good</p>
<p>Today, after more HTML testing, I decided that I should try and develop a basic HTML structure for SNU instead of depending on Google sites or Javascript any longer</p>
<p>It is almost like a sign. The HTML hyperlink error lead to so many discoveries, I began looking up how to do all these different things. Now I have</p>
<p>After I successfully managed to embed images, audio, and video into HTML, along with other skills like opening files in other folders, hosting downloads, and opening documents within documents, I moved from my HTML testing ground into the real environment</p>
<p>I am going to try and take it slowly so I don't have to restart again. I think version 3 has a lot of potential. Someday, I will get this site working</p>
<p>Today, I started out with development on the basic site elements such as pseudocode, front pages, trending, and assets. I laid the foundation today</p>

<H1>SNU 3.0 Developer log day 2</H1>
<p>Today is another big day in Modern SNU development. I began to work on the profiles for staff and companies. Getting the layout for staff right is important, along with users (coming tomorrow) today, I just established a home base for the sites community</p>
<p>Today wasn't the most exciting day in development, but some important progress was made</p>

<H1>SNU 3.0 Developer log day 3</H1>
<p>SNU has received a massive update today, mainly involving user profiles. I have put in lots of effort today into making a template account that mimics what a profile looks like</p>
<p>I think it is a pretty good example. However, it is going to take A LOT of work. So far, just the basic HTML is over 80 Kilobytes in size. I haven't even added any styles or many images yet</p>
<p>I burnt myself out of it for the day, and I began to port SNU 2.0 into the root folder. SNU 2.0 was a failure, but its code establishes a lot of ideas and commitments that I am going to take inspiration from and live up to</p>
<p>Just taking this one day at a time, I will eventually get a good layout finished and a good testing server.</p>
<p>Also, I am going to start using paragraphs and bolding instead of just all headings for my HTML style</p>
<p>One last thing, I have decided to start and keep documentation in the blog section of the profile test account (where you currently are) it may get copied in the future, but the original will remain here</p>

<p>I didn't have the best development day today, not much was added, and I was caught up in a lot of other things. I got burnt out of the project a bit yesterday and it lasted into today</p>
<p>Hopefully tomorrow is better</p>

<p>Today was a better day in development. So the user profile now has an immense amount of sections, currently totaling at 125. Today was mostly an index update, along with adding settings, and fixing up the blog sections</p>
<p>Today was A LOT better than yesterday at least</p>

<H1>SNU 3.0 Developer log day 15</H1>
<p>I have now reached the point with this site where it is as functional as SNU 1. I can legitimately say I am browsing SNU. However, this is just the structure. The fun part comes later. However, I haven't outperformed the original SNU yet, however some of its content is finally over to the new site</p>
<p>Today, I worked on making alternates to the rich formatting versions of specific pages, increasing documentation, and working on blogs. I got a lot done again today as well. I also updated the site to version 3.04 and added Big Buck Bunny content in. Since I added over 10 gigabytes today, I have decided I will follow a new update schedule:</p>
<p>I will continue working on the site daily, but I can't make an entirely new version all the time. I can only make a new version every 4 months. This is to conserve the last 490 Gigabytes on my laptops hard drive. This is the way it will be until I get a new computer or a better spot for memory</p>
<P>It's valentines day today btw</p>

<H1>SNU 3.0 Developer log day 16</H1>
<p>Today was a pretty good day in development. I was able to do a lot. I added a home page for the game Façade, and I actually made a working update log that is up to date. I got burnt out really bad at the end, hopefully tomorrow is better</p>
<p>There are just so many files, it is getting hard to manage, and folder switching is difficult too due to HTML limitations</p>
<p>I got a temporary burn-out on the project for the first time in 4 days, I just need a small break</p>

<H1>SNU 3.0 Developer log day 17</H1>
<p>After some research, I decided that I need to put a little less focus on customizing menus and such and work on making the foundation for a good algorithm. There are lots of variables and conditions that go into the SNU algorithm, and it is going to take YEARS to implemeent</p>
<p>I am really hoping I don't have to make another re-write, 3 versions is already alot. It took Microsoft 3 tries for Windows, and they got it on the third try. I haven't been as lucky yet, however none of my projects have been publically released</p>
<p>SNU 3 has a chance, maybe even SNU 1 if Google can give me my website back already. It just won't let me download it</p>

<H1>SNU 3.0 Developer log day 18</H1>
<p>I am really happy with the complete makeover of the start page yesterday. It looks great. Today, I re-implemented some older SNU features such as gilding, achievements, and leveling up. I also did a little maintenance to the Valve legends page</p>
<p>I have finally started taking snapshots of separate files on these builds. I should have done this sooner. Now I can make updates to pages separately without copying over the entire directory, which is over 15 gigabytes, and that is not an option anymore due to the space required for frequent backups</p>
<p>Snapshots are now another new way to view older versions of a page, while keeping the modern page in-tact</p>
<p>I went to test Google sites downloading again today. I downloaded the old, old SNU, but not the version 1. Still waiting on that. At least we have SNU 0.1 now</p>

<H1>SNU 3.0 Developer log day 19</H1>
<p>Not much of an update today. Today is the last day of my 6 day break. I added a few features such as the cookie jar, and upload center</p>
<p>There is now full access to SNU 0 but it doesn't feel like much. Just a bunch of extra HTML work for nothing. Hopefully people enjoy it</p>
<p>I was going to make a tribute to Pie-Pivot-o, a YouTuber who died a couple days ago due to suicide, but I just didn't have the time</p>
<p>I updated the HTML references so that they easier for me and other developers to access. There is now a 2 way system to the resources and it works pretty well</p>

<p>Other than that, not much else was done to the site today. I updated the update log, and worked a little on the blog section but that is pretty much it.</p>

<p>I was going to try and add content to this site today and make a huge update, but instead, I got distracted with a big video project, schoolwork, and some time on YouTube and reddit</p>

<p>A small update today, but a little bigger than yesterday's. I have a lot of ideas, but I cannot implement all of them today.

<H1>SNU 3.0 Developer log day 24</H1>
<p>I am back from my vacation. I have some updates</p>
<p>I did some work on this site today on the car trip back to Walla Walla. </p>
<p>Mostly, the work I did was for the pie pivot-o archive. I got 20 videos embedded during the car ride</p>
<p>So I have to make a website for my parents apartment. I don't have a server to dedicate to this, and my HTML and web development skills aren't good enough to make this on my local harddrive so for now, I am going to have to make it in Google sites</p>
<p>Once Google allows downloading your modern Google sites websites, it will be all good. This is a mini-project, it shouldn't take long, and it would give me a little exposure</p>
<p>I made a basic demo of the site today, and it works well</p>

<p>Today was an easy day for this project. I haven't been feeling that good, a lot of anxiery pain. So I finished up the Pie Pivot-o Tribute by adding all video descriptions, and his opinion on CharmX, and I also added 2 new features to SNU:</p>
<p>User !666 and !Heaven</p>
<p>The 666 user is SNUs personal hell. You can visit it, where I try to make the most demonic scary part of the site. I also made a transition and made SNU heaven, a place with the all-time best content, and links to the fallen creators</p>
<p>I did some updates to the update log and the developer log, and that is pretty much it.</p>

<p>I am really glad I introduced the new snapshot system into this SNU project. Recently this morning, there was a severe system crash. My computer froze for over 20 minutes, and I lost 20 minutes worth of work on a new build on a different project</p>
<p>It would be really unfortunate to lose ANY page in this collection, so Snapshots are going to be important</p>
<p>Today, I am rebooting development on Legends of the Internet. Today, I focus on Vinesauce and 4Chan</p>
<p>I am also working on the new time-machine mode, viewing media from different time periods. Currently it goes down all the way to 1788</p>

<p>SNU is not dead, but it is going to need to be repaired a little bit. I am going to start doing big repairs when I get better at CSS, I am just starting with it. HTML seems easy but CSS really makes it fun. Today, I simply updated the developer and update logs.</p>

<p>These easter eggs are fun to make, and they reward the user with something fun to do. Today, we made a built-in game where you get to beat up hitler with a wide range of weapons and hit locations.</p>
<p>SNU hell is pretty scary, but it can be exciting. SNU hell will also be a place to punish bad accounts and user botting</p>

<p>5G is coming soon, and it will be a great advantage to this site. It will take some time before it becomes mainstream enough that constant use of SNU doesn't begin throttling, or when they make unlimited data, actually unlimuted. Kind of frustrating how all the phone companies adopted that false term</p>
<p>5G will be the only mode that can run SNU 3D and use it smoothly, due to the immense amount of bandwidth required per user (constant 2 Gigabit per second per user) SNU 2D will load at its best in 5G, and for 1D mode, 3G, 4G, and 5G are overkill</p>
<p>Today, I got no progress on the site, I was working on a Factorial Machine for my calculator, and I managed to perfect it to its limits. Development on SNU will continue tomorrow.</p>

<p>These easter eggs are fun to make, and they reward the user with something fun to do. Today, we made a built-in game where you get to beat up hitler with a wide range of weapons and hit locations.</p>
<p>SNU hell is pretty scary, but it can be exciting. SNU hell will also be a place to punish bad accounts and user botting</p>

<p>5G is coming soon, and it will be a great advantage to this site. It will take some time before it becomes mainstream enough that constant use of SNU doesn't begin throttling, or when they make unlimited data, actually unlimuted. Kind of frustrating how all the phone companies adopted that false term</p>
<p>5G will be the only mode that can run SNU 3D and use it smoothly, due to the immense amount of bandwidth required per user (constant 2 Gigabit per second per user) SNU 2D will load at its best in 5G, and for 1D mode, 3G, 4G, and 5G are overkill</p>
<p>Today, I got no progress on the site, I was working on a Factorial Machine for my calculator, and I managed to perfect it to its limits. Development on SNU will continue tomorrow.</p>

<p>Today was a slight comeback day. I did some work on my calculator, and some work on SNU, not much, but it is still progress</p>

<H2>SNU 3.0 Developer log day 35</H2>
<p>Nothing happened today. I am having issues with time and my medication, but I will pull through</p>

<H1>SNU 3.0 Developer log day 36</H1>
<p>Not much happened today. I made some minor changes, and some HTTP error screens such as 404 and 403. For some reason, adding rhese errors make the site seem more official to me, even though I really dislike 404s on a web server. I don't like stuff going away forever.</p>

<H1>SNU 3.0 Developer log day 37</H1>
<p>I am on new medication, and my projects are at a more even state, so hopefully I can work on SNU better today. However, I have other projects first - 6:11 am</p>
<p>By 12:38 pm, I have gotten significant progress on the site, mainly working on status codes and geo-blocking, along with tags, definitions, and snapshots. I have made significant progress today, but now I need a break</p>

<H1>SNU 3.0 Developer log day 38</H1>
<p>Yesterday was a really productive day. Today wasn't. I was really hyper today, and had a lack of focus on different projects. I wasn't able to do anything to SNU today. So I have also grown a new hobby, bookmarks. This is a small hobby, I am making a very organized bookmarks file system in Firefox to help me organizr tabs better. This list will be updated and added to SNU every day a change is made. </a>
<p>This hobby should not replace SNU</p>
<p>Later in the day, I hit a limit, then surpassed it with bookmarks and separaters. I thought there was a limit, but I just made an error. However just today, the number of bookmarks and separaters over doubled with my bookmark archive and I didn't get much done with SNU except for a basic stylesheet on the start page, archive updates, and writing to the blog</p>
<p>Today could have been a lot better, hopefully my excitement with bookmarks will go down soon</p>

<H1>SNU 3.0 Developer log day 39</H1>
<p>I got back to work on SNU today, and made some changes, such as standard updates and snapshots, access to a new alt account for Sean, and updates to the Filthy Frank tribute. I also got through the first week of my new bookmark frenzy</a>

<H1>SNU 3.0 Developer log day 40</H1>
<p>My bookmark project reached its first issue this morning. I found out that there is a limit on dividers. Hopefully there isn't a limit on folders and bookmarks as well</p>

<H1>SNU 3.0 Developer log day 41</H1>
<p>Development hasn't been going that well lately. The Filthy Frank tribute is also going to be reset, as I found a master archive with all his videos, and I can't apply it right now as I need to conserve memory better.</p>
<p>I have also been developing SNU mostly in English. I need to make it available to other languages, but I don't have any secondary languages I am good at, and I cannot rely on Google translate.</p>
<p>So I am going to have to work on smaller features, by the kilobyte, NOT THE MEGABYTE OR GIGABYTE.</p>
<p>One of my new ideas this morning is personal pages for peoples pets. This will require some moderation, but wouldn't it be nice to be able to create a separate account specially designed for animals?</p>
<p>There are a lot of projects I am working on right now and it is going to correlate to SNU very well. There are a few features in beta right now:</p>
<p>Password generator [Python] current version: 1.04</p>
<b>A password generator that allows for intricate password generation from 9 to 256 characters</b>
<p>WebShapes3D [Java] current version: 1.00</p>
<b>A 3D environment for 3D animations and objects on SNU</b>
<p>Today, I applied some minor updates. Development should continue again normally soon</p>

<H1>SNU 3.0 Developer log day 42</H1>
<p>I have had a large influx of ideas for SNU today, and I am trying to implement as many as possible. I have been really productive lately, except for a severe laptop issue that has happened for the second time: it randomly deep froze. The only way to stop the freeze was to shut down</p>
<p>I don't know what is causing it, but I do NOT want to have to go get a fourth/fifth laptop this year, the other 2 I had were returned because they overheated and shut down within 5 minutes of bootup.</p>
<p>Due to my new experience in JavaScript, I might start development on the 3D side of SNU pretty soon, if I can get better experience in CSS and JS.</p>
